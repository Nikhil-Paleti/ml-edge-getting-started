# Machine Learning at the edge getting started

Here you can find samples, tutorials, reference architectures and other resources to help you to build your own ML@Edge (Machine Learning at the Edge) solution at AWS.

## Tutorials/Reference implementations
|Use Case|Description|
|-|-|
|[How to detect anomalies in "Wind Turbines" in real-time?](samples/onnx_accelerator_sample1/)|This sample provides an end-to-end solution that manages the lifecycle of an anomaly detection model, deployed to a simulated fleet of wind turbine|
|[How to classify images in the browser?](samples/onnx_accelerator_sample2/)|This sample provides an end-to-end solution that manages the lifecycle of an image detection model, deployed to a local device (laptop, mobile)|

## Contributing
If you have a question related to a business challenge that must be answered by an accelerated AI/ML solution, like the content in this repo, then you can contribute. You can just open an issue with your question or if you have the skills, implement a solution (tutorial, workshop, etc.) using Jupyter notebooks (for SageMaker Studio or Notebook Instances) and create a pull request. We appreciate your help.
